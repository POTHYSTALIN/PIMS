Need to add the functionality to make a ajax to get & notify the tasks from table.
Add one more menu for Tips & Tricks
	- Create DB schema for this module
	- Types ( Mitrahsoft, PC, commandbox, technical etc )
	- Tags for quick search for that
	- Should have a rich text editor like ckeditor for adding content.
	- Add some process to add placeholders for special rendering
Add one more menu for Task manager
	- a special kind of events, as we don't need to do that within a specific date.

-- Need to change the events click to show the currently clicked day, instead of showing current day.
-- Need to add signup page & add the ability for admin to make a newly registered user with more roles.
